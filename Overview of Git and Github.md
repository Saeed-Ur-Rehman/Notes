## What is github?

git is a version control system that is free and open source and it&#39;s the most widely used version control system in development today most programmers interact with git on a daily basis.

## What is version control version control?

Version control is basically a way that we as programmers track our code changes, we basically save an initial version of our code into git and then when we update code we can save it into get again and again and again and again and throughout time as our code continues to change we can look back at all of the changes we have made over time this helps us to see and understand what we did when as well as track down bugs or go back to a previous version of the code if we need to.

## Directory

which is also known as a folder on your computer.

## Terminal or command line or CLI (Command Line Interface)

An application that runs on your computer which is just an interface where you can type in text commands you can navigate around files and folders create files change update things install and run

programs and much more.

## CD (Change Directory)

## Code Editor

Code Editor is a place to write code. These are special text editors that are designed with lots of tools and features for programmers.

## Repository

In the world of programming it usually refers to a git repository which is basically just your project or the folder place where your project is kept.

# What is difference between git and github?

git is the tool that tracks the changes in your code over time github is a website where you host all of your git repositories being online it makes it easy to work in groups with other people and organize your projects into a portfolio for you to show potential employers.

# How to open an account on github?

The first thing you will need to do is of course sign up for an account on github this is pretty straightforward you enter minimal information and then you sign up for an account you will get an email

that will ask you to verify and then you can log into your account.

# How to create a repository?

when you log in you will either be on the page which is your profile page that you can access from the drop-down menu or you might be on the dashboard page here either way you will have access to a green button here or the plus sign and the drop down here where you can create a new repository.

A repository is basically a project it&#39;s all of your coding files and folders for whatever kind of application that you are building.

Now click on create a new repository here give it a name for example &quot;demo app&quot;. Leave all the settings as they are and click create repository. The repository is created now.

You can create your files and folders for this repository locally on your machine or you can create them

straight in the online editor on the github website.

# How to create a new file?

Now Let&#39;s go ahead and create a basic markdown file called a readme and this is the most basic file

that you will find in almost every project that contains text to describe what the project is about what it does and any other relevant information. Click here create a new file and name it &quot;README.md&quot;. MD here is for markdown. Markdown is basically an easy way to format your text in these sorts of

files. Now put some sort of text here in this file.

Scroll to the bottom to commit the file in other words save this file.
